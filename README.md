# Sexism-Detection
In this project, I fine-tuned a pre-trained DistilBERT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library on a dataset containing both sexist and non-sexist text. The fine-tuned model was optimized to accurately predict the label of a given text, identifying whether it falls into the sexist or non-sexist category.
